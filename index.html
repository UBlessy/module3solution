          Shawn Mendes Treat you better lyrics as sample text
         I won't lie to you I know he's just not right for you And you can tell me if I'm off
         But I see it on your face When you say that he's the one that you want
         And you're spending all your time
         In this wrong situation
         And anytime you want it to stop
         I know I can treat you better than he can
         And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
         Tell me why are we wasting time
         On all your wasted crying
         When you should be with me instead?
         I know I can treat you better
         Better than he can
         I'll stop time for you
         The second you say you'd like me to
         I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
         Baby, just to wake up with you
         Would be everything I need, and this could be so different
         Tell me what you want to do
         'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
         And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
         Tell me why are we wasting time
         On all your wasted crying
         When you should be with me instead?
         I know I can treat you better
         Better than he can
         Better than he can
         Give me a sign
         Take my hand, we'll be fine
         Promise I won't let you down
         Just know that you don't have to do this alone
         Promise I'll never let you down
         'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
         And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
